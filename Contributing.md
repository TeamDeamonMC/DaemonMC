DaemonMC is not supposed to be feature rich complete server software but core for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that functionality can be extended with plugins. That means that pull requests containing implementations that can be done with plugins like weather, chat messages or mob AI won't be accepted. Some examples of implementations that can't be extended with plugins and will be accepted are: missing API methods or inability to override or something that limits or makes impossible to achieve expected functionality with plugin API. Also pull requests containing various core fixes and improvements will be accepted.

Before making pull request make sure it:

 - Contains only one change (like "added camera api". Not like "added various events and methods")
 - It follows same code style
 - It's tested and works on Windows and Linux operating systems
 - It contains only your code (not copy paste from someone else)
 - It doesn't contains functionality that can be achieved by plugins
