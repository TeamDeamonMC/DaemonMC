Nothing much. Just one night project I made for fun. This is basic, I wouldn't even call it a server, but something that can respond to Minecraft Bedrock edition Unconnected Ping.

Plugin support is here! Not really useful yet because there is just few API methods at the moment but there will be more. API documentation is here in [Wiki](https://github.com/laz1444/DaemonMC/wiki)

That was really hard. Lack of chunk serialization docs and knowledge BUT... It works. Now it is possible to load mcworld World files. Still unstable but simple and flat words works. I know where is the problem, just need to figure out how to fix. Merry Christmas!

It is now possible to join the server. I actually didn't think that I will make it so far but it happened.

From "one night project for fun" this thing now have almost fully working RakNet implementation (ok actually a lot of thing still have to be done) and it can also process Bedrock packets (at least should, hard to test because it's not possible to have stable connection with Minecraft yet).
